---
## Questions
- All three topics?
- R or Stata for simulation and application?
- Replicate random forest results?
- Find the real data?
- Code from CompStat?
- Data generating process for simulation study? How many different should we consider?

## Meeting
Focus on Lasso. Group that works on Lasso estimation. Brief introduction in Lasso estimation. Properties of Lasso. How to choose the tuning parameter. 

Go through steps of covariance selection. Lasso for IV selection not doing good jobs and then pin down issues.

Connection between theory and application part. Assumptions for Lasso estimation. Sparsity assumption and low dimension of coefficients.

## Allocation of Topics
- Cristian: Theory
    - Should I try a simulation with normally distributed regressors or uniformly distributed is enough?
    - What happens under different penalties?
        - According to literature prediction does not improve.
    - How should we defined the tunning parameter (lambda)?
    - How do glmnet package manage deliver results for OLS under          high-dimensionality ?
- Marcel: Simulation
## To Do:
- Run Code for Lasso
