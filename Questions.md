## Meeting
Focus on Lasso. Group that works on Lasso estimation. Brief introduction in Lasso estimation. Properties of Lasso. How to choose the tuning parameter. 

Go through steps of covariance selection. Lasso for IV slection not doing good jobs and then pin down issues.

Connection between theory and application part. Assumptions for Lasso estimation. Sparsity assumption and low dimension of coefficients.
